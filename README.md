# ML in Python
This is my playground repo for my refresh process of several years using matlab, and R in several ML tasks. Here, I focus on try to complete a typical stack of an ML engineer completely in Python. Classical models from the basics (trees, linear models) to the more complex ones (deep learning, nlp) will be part of those notebooks

## Frameworks
1. NumPy 
2. Matplotlib
3. scikit-learn
4. Tensorflow
5. CuPy and Rapids

## Topics
1. Basics of NumPy (I, II), [Tensors](https://github.com/maurosc3ner/ml_python_playground/blob/main/book_fchollet/dl_chollet_ch2_ch3.ipynb)  and Matplotlib
2. Web scrapping with requests and beatifulsoup
3. Decision trees
   * Random Forest
   * Greadient Boosted Decision trees
4. Regression using GLMs
5. Singular Value Decomposition and PCA
6. K-Means|K-NN
7. SVM
8. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
10. DBSCAN
11. Time-series forecasting
