# ML in Python
This is my playground repo for my refresh process of several years using matlab, and R in several ML tasks. I will focus on try to complete a typical stack of an ML engineer completely in Python. Classical models from the basics (trees, linear models) to the more complex ones (deep learning, nlp) will be part of those notebooks

## Frameworks
1. NumPy 
2. Matplotlib
3. scikit-learn
4. Tensorflow
5. CuPy and Rapids

## Topics
1. Basics of NumPy (I, II) and Matplotlib
2. Greadient Boosted Decision trees
3. Generalized linear models
4. Random Forest
5. Singular Value Decomposition and PCA
6. K-Means|K-NN
7. SVM
8. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
9. DBSCAN
10. Arima (time series)+Fourier
11. UMAP and t-SNE
12. Deep learning
    * Regression
    * Classification
    * Convolutional neural networks
    * Transfer learning
14. Project: Visual search and image retrieval
15. NLP
16. Other topics: data wrangling+SQL
